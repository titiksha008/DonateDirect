                    <h4>Homeless Shelter</h4>
                    <p>The number of sheltered individuals with chronic patterns of homelessness increased by 20% between 2020 and 2021. This is a challenge that we are tackling with full heart and compassion. For those with no safe place to go or in need of emergency shelter, local Salvation Army shelters provide a warm, secure place for homeless men, women, and children to stay.

                        At The Salvation Army, our doors are open every day — and night — of the year. Through our emergency housing facilities, homeless shelters, transitional living centers, group homes, and family shelters, we provide more than 8 million nights of lodging annually.

                        In some cities where we do not currently operate homeless shelters, we help provide financial assistance to cover emergency overnight housing costs or refer those facing food insecurity and those at risk of homelessness to trusted partner programs with emergency shelter services.</p>

                <div class="service">
                    <h4>Transitional Housing</h4>
                    <p>Our transitional housing programs are designed to transition unhoused people into more permanent living situations. In many programs, The Salvation Army provides case management, child care, job skills training, substance abuse counseling, job placement, and referral to resources when needed.

                        Often our facilities will partner with other local agencies to serve a particular community’s need. For instance, The Salvation Army White Mountain Outpost has teamed up with the White Mountain Coalition Against Homelessness to open and run a brand-new transitional housing program in Lakeside, Arizona. In addition to these services, our programs also offer life skills workshops and financial literacy training to help individuals
                        build a foundation for long-term stability. By addressing both immediate needs and underlying challenges, we empower participants to regain independence and successfully reintegrate into society.</p>
